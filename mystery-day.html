<h1>The mystery of July 15, 1982</h1>

<h2>What aired that evening?</h2>


<p>The HBO Guide for July of 1982 has the Hagler vs. Hearns fight listed at 9 pm, but it never happened. 
Thomas Hearns initially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/09/sports/hagler-hearns-called-off.html">dropped out</a> and was replaced by Fulgencio Obelmejias, but then that was 
<a href="https://nyti.ms/4hkyVCe">cancelled</a> due to an injury from Hagler and rescheduled for Oct. 30th. 
This happened after the guides were set to print, so trying to figure out what HBO actually aired that night 
is a bit of a mystery due to conflicting sources.</p>

<p>This notice was found on <a href="http://newspapers.com">newspapers.com</a> by a member of 
the <em>Vintage HBO Guides! group on Facebook:</em></p>

<p>But I also found this TV Listing on archive.org that shows something different:</p>

<p>And yet another account comes from the listings in the N.Y. Times:</p>

   <p>What really aired?  Perhaps the answer is on a betamax cassette mislabeled <q>Hagler Hearns Fight"</q> 
   stored in a box in someone's attic?</p>
